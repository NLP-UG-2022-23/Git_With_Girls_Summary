# Psycholinguistics

Psycholinguistics is indeed the scientific study of how people comprehend, produce, and acquire language. It combines principles and methods from psychology and linguistics to investigate how language is processed and represented in the human mind.

## Aim

Psycholinguistics aims to uncover the cognitive processes and mechanisms underlying various aspects of language, such as speech perception, word recognition, sentence processing, and discourse comprehension. It investigates questions related to how individuals comprehend the meaning of words and sentences, how they produce coherent and meaningful speech, how language is stored and accessed in memory, and how language is acquired and learned.

## Application
 
By examining the mental processes involved in language use, psycholinguistics provides valuable insights into the nature of human language processing. It helps us understand the mechanisms that allow us to comprehend and produce language, as well as the factors that influence language comprehension and production. Psycholinguistic research often involves experiments and data analysis to gather empirical evidence about language processing and to develop theories and models that explain these processes.

Pragmatics is the study of how context affects meaning. It involves analyzing physical and linguistic context to understand communication.

### Deixis

Deixis means 'pointing'. Sometimes, in discourse, you may 'point' to a person, time, or place. Context is always necessary to understand deixis. Consider this example:

There are three types of deictic expressions in this sentence:

- Person deixis: *He* refers to a person, understood by the listener in context.
- Spatial deixis: *Here* refers to a place, understood by the listener in context.
- Temporal deixis: *Last night* refers to the night before the utterance of the sentence, which also depends on context.

## Reference

Reference means to refer to something in the real world. However, context is often necessary to determine the specific reference, and this is where pragmatics plays a role. There are two key topics related to reference:

1. **Inference:** In some cases, inference is required to identify what a speaker is referring to. For instance, when we hear the sentence "I played some Chopin on the piano," we can infer that "some Chopin" refers to piano works composed by Frederic Chopin.

2. **Anaphora:** Anaphora occurs when we refer back to something previously mentioned. Consider the example: "I saw a strange guy last night. He was wearing a T-shirt with the Wikibooks logo. I tried waving, but the guy didn't respond." In this case, the anaphoric expressions "he" and "the guy" both refer back to the antecedent "a strange guy."

## Presupposition

Presupposition refers to the hidden assumptions made during communication. An example is the New Zealand referendum question: "Should a smack as part of good parental correction be a criminal offense in New Zealand?" Regardless of whether the answer is yes or no, there is a common presupposition: a smack is considered a part of good parental correction. The constancy under negation, where the "no" answer still acknowledges smacking as "good parental correction," helps to identify this presupposition.

Here are a few more examples of presupposition:

- "Where is your book about pragmatics?" - The presupposition is that the listener has a book about pragmatics.
- "Why do you like pragmatics?" - The presupposition is that the listener likes pragmatics.

## Implicature

Implicature refers to implied meanings that are conveyed in communication. There are two main types:

1. Conventional implicature: A phrase implies something in any context. For example, "He is sometimes nasty" implies that he isn't always nasty.

2. Conversational implicature: The implicature depends on the context of the communication.

It's crucial to differentiate implicature from entailment and presupposition. Implicatures are not logical necessities that can be deduced from the sentence, unlike entailments and most presuppositions.

## Speech Acts

According to speech act theory, utterances serve various purposes beyond conveying information. They can be categorized into three levels:

- Locution: The act of saying an utterance.
- Illocution: The purpose or function intended by the utterance.
- Perlocution: The effect or impact of the utterance on the listener.

## Speech Act Classification

Speech acts can be classified into two categories:

1. Direct Speech Acts: The illocutionary force is determined by the syntactic structure of the utterance. For example:
   - "Please turn on the fans." - This direct speech act is a command, as it uses the imperative sentence structure to ask the listener to turn on the fans.

2. Indirect Speech Acts: The illocutionary force is not directly associated with the syntactic structure of the utterance. For example:
   - "Could you please turn on the fans?" - This indirect speech act is an interrogative, but it functions as a command. The speaker is indirectly asking the listener to turn on the fans.

## Searle's Classification of Speech Acts


According to Searle, speech acts can be classified into five types:

1. Directive: Refers to commands or requests. Examples include:
   - "Please turn on the fans."
   - "You should probably turn on the fans."
   - "Could you please turn on the fans?"

2. Expressive: Expresses feelings or emotions. Examples include:
   - "Nice to meet you!"
   - "Why, oh why, did you go?"
   - "I'm really excited about the camp."

3. Declaration: The speech act actually performs an action or brings about a new state of affairs. An example is:
   - "I hereby declare Wikibooks to be the Website of the Year." (In older systems, this is known as a performative.)

4. Commissive: Involves making a commitment or promising to do something in the future. Examples include:
   - "I'll be there by noon."
   - "I'll see what I can do about your request."

5. Representative: Describes or states a particular state of affairs. For example:
   - "I'm a little teapot."

These classifications help in understanding the different intentions and functions of speech acts.

## Felicity Conditions of Speech Acts

Felicity conditions are the conditions that need to be satisfied for a speech act to be successful. While there are various conditions discussed in the literature, the following are the most common ones:

1. Preparatory conditions: The speaker must have the authority or ability to perform the speech act, and the situation should be appropriate for the act to occur. For example, if someone without knowledge of computers says, "I will fix the computer tomorrow," the preparatory condition is not met.

2. Sincerity conditions: The speaker is expected to genuinely mean what they say during the speech act. For instance, if a son says "Yes" to his mother's request to tidy up his room but does not actually intend to clean it, the sincerity condition is not fulfilled.

3. Essential conditions: The listener should understand the purpose or intention behind the speech act. If, for example, someone says, "Let's break the ice," but the listener takes it literally and tries to find ice to break, the essential condition is not met.

These felicity conditions play a crucial role in ensuring effective communication and successful execution of speech acts.

Morphology is the identification, analysis, and description of the structure of words, practiced by morphologists.

**Morphemes**

A morpheme is the smallest linguistic unit that carries semantic meaning. It is indivisible and cannot be further broken down. For example, the word "boy" is a single morpheme as it cannot be divided into smaller meaningful units.

However, some words consist of multiple morphemes. For instance, the word "antigovernment" can be broken down into three morphemes: "anti-" (meaning against), "govern" (meaning to rule/administrate), and "-ment" (a noun suffix).

It is important to avoid mistakenly breaking a single morpheme into multiple constituent morphemes. This error is common in the analysis of certain languages like Chinese. The word "犹豫" (yóuyù), meaning "hesitate," is an example. In the past, due to the belief that Chinese characters represented single morphemes, there were absurd speculations about its meaning. However, later discoveries revealed that "犹豫" is a single disyllabic morpheme, debunking those unfounded claims.

**Classifying Morphemes**

Morphemes can be categorized as follows:

1. **Bound morphemes**: These morphemes cannot stand alone and are typically affixes. They modify the meaning or grammatical category of a word. Examples include prefixes like "re-", "de-", "un-", and suffixes like "-ness" and "-ly".

2. **Derivational morphemes**: They change the grammatical category or meaning of a word. Examples include affixes that can transform a verb into a noun or an adjective, or vice versa.

3. **Inflectional morphemes**: These morphemes do not alter the meaning or grammatical category of a word but indicate aspects such as plurality, tense, agreement, case, etc.

4. **Free morphemes**: These morphemes can function as standalone words and do not require any additional morphemes to convey meaning.

5. **Lexical morphemes**: They represent the main concepts and content of the message. Examples include words like "ship," "orange," and "president." Lexical morphemes form an open set of words in a language.

6. **Functional morphemes**: These morphemes serve functional purposes in a language, such as determiners, pronouns, conjunctions, etc. Examples include words like "whatever," "because," and "against."
