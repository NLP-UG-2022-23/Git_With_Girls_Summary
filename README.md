## Pragmatics

Pragmatics is the study of how context affects meaning. It involves analyzing physical and linguistic context to understand communication.

### Deixis

Deixis means 'pointing'. Sometimes, in discourse, you may 'point' to a person, time, or place. Context is always necessary to understand deixis. Consider this example:

There are three types of deictic expressions in this sentence:

- Person deixis: *He* refers to a person, understood by the listener in context.
- Spatial deixis: *Here* refers to a place, understood by the listener in context.
- Temporal deixis: *Last night* refers to the night before the utterance of the sentence, which also depends on context.

## Reference

Reference means to refer to something in the real world. However, context is often necessary to determine the specific reference, and this is where pragmatics plays a role. There are two key topics related to reference:

1. **Inference:** In some cases, inference is required to identify what a speaker is referring to. For instance, when we hear the sentence "I played some Chopin on the piano," we can infer that "some Chopin" refers to piano works composed by Frederic Chopin.

2. **Anaphora:** Anaphora occurs when we refer back to something previously mentioned. Consider the example: "I saw a strange guy last night. He was wearing a T-shirt with the Wikibooks logo. I tried waving, but the guy didn't respond." In this case, the anaphoric expressions "he" and "the guy" both refer back to the antecedent "a strange guy."

## Presupposition

Presupposition refers to the hidden assumptions made during communication. An example is the New Zealand referendum question: "Should a smack as part of good parental correction be a criminal offense in New Zealand?" Regardless of whether the answer is yes or no, there is a common presupposition: a smack is considered a part of good parental correction. The constancy under negation, where the "no" answer still acknowledges smacking as "good parental correction," helps to identify this presupposition.

Here are a few more examples of presupposition:

- "Where is your book about pragmatics?" - The presupposition is that the listener has a book about pragmatics.
- "Why do you like pragmatics?" - The presupposition is that the listener likes pragmatics.
